//TODO: This question is optional. It's bonus if you don't search or copy anything from the internet.

//and how can you make this better.

//Question 6: EA's and Google's Interview question

//You work in a 100 floor building and you get 2 identical eggs. 
//You need to figure out the highest floor an egg can be dropped without breaking. 
//Find an algorithm that is minimizing number of throws in the worst-case scenario.
//Code is not necessary. You can explain with your own words.
//You can make some assumptions like:
//1)If an egg doesn’t break when dropped from some floor, then it will not break when dropped from any lower floors.
//2)An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
//3)A broken egg must be discarded.
//4)The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
//5)If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.
